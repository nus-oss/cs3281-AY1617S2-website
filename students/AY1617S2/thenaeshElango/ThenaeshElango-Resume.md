## Open-Source Contributions

### [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)

[Implemented a feature](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/3421) that allows users to specify a User-Agent string when requesting a document from a URL using Pandoc. This solved the problem of web servers insisting on specific browsers and refusing to serve up pages in response to requests from Pandoc.

### [SE-EDU Learning Resources](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources)

[Contributed a Haskell learning guide](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/pull/21) (WIP) to a repository of software engineering educational resources created by the National University of Singapore.

### [NUSComputingDev](https://github.com/NUSComputingDev)

[Created an intuitive GUI](https://github.com/NUSComputingDev/CompClubEmailBlast) for a previously command-line app to facilitate sending mass emails formatted in a given way to ease the workload of publicity personnel who would otherwise have to do it manually each time and have to worry about writing HTML and sending the email using the correct email server.
