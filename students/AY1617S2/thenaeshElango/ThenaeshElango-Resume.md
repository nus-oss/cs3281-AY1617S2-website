  * Served as TA several times for a programming module (CS1101S) that taught students a useful and clean subset of JavaScript
  * Made major contributions to the TEAMMATES project's JavaScript code (including a huge ES3 -> ES6 migration), gaining significant experience with industry-standard tools such as ESLint in the process
  * Gave a talk regarding ES6 (for CS3281)

## Open-Source Contributions

### [TEAMMATES](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com)

[Made many contributions](ThenaeshElango-Progress) to TEAMMATES, currently serving as a committer.

### [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)

[Implemented a feature](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/3421) that allows users to specify a User-Agent string when requesting a document from a URL using Pandoc. This solved the problem of web servers insisting on specific browsers and refusing to serve up pages in response to requests from Pandoc. _Implementation Language: Haskell_

### [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)

[Make minor documentation fix](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8468) to ensure that users that the `functions` option of the `comma-dangle` rule should not be used on JavaScript code prior to ECMAScript 2017. This solved a bug report from a user who was confused why ESLint, when run with trailing commas enforced for function parameter lists,  was producing JS code that resulted in errors when run.

### [SE-EDU Learning Resources](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources)

[Contributed a Haskell learning guide](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/pull/21) to a repository of software engineering educational resources created by the National University of Singapore.

### [SE-EDU AddressBook Level 2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2)

[Wrote tests](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2/pull/121) for an important part of the codebase.

### [NUSComputingDev](https://github.com/NUSComputingDev)

[Created an intuitive GUI](https://github.com/NUSComputingDev/CompClubEmailBlast) for a previously command-line app to facilitate sending mass emails formatted in a given way to ease the workload of publicity personnel who would otherwise have to do it manually each time and have to worry about writing HTML and sending the email using the correct email server. _Implementation Language: JavaScript (ES6)_

### [Rhythm](https://github.com/thenaesh/Rhythm)

Built the MIDI and audio subsystem for an in-browser piano web app developed for Orbital in NUS SoC. Upon keystrokes, musical notes are played through a MIDI subsystem. Chords and multiple keys are also playable and supported by the MIDI system.


## Work Experience


#### Teaching Assistant for CS1101S Programming Methodology, __National University of Singapore__

* _August 2015 - December 2015_
* _August 2016 - December 2016_
* Led a discussion group of 8 students, teaching them programming initially from a functional perspective and later from an imperative perspective.
* Taught in JavaScript (initially severely restricted, more features allowed each week).
* Graded programming assignments and midterm examinations.
* Created and maintained teaching materials for the course.
* Handled administrative work for various aspects of the course.


#### Teaching Assistant for CS1231 Discrete Structures, _National University of Singapore_

* _August 2015 - December 2015_
* Taught a tutorial of 20+ students, teaching them mathematics fundamentals, including set theory, functions, relations, mathematical induction, basic number theory, combinatorics and graph theory.
* Graded written assignments.


## Community Service


#### Software Engineer & System Administrator, _National University of Singapore Students' Computing Club_

* _August 2016 - September 2017_ (19th IT Subcommittee)
* Simplified the creation of the Club's weekly email blasts:
  * Created an Electron app that allows entry of email blast parameters (title, image, text) in a simple, intuitive format.
  * Great advancement over the old command-line interface that was difficult to use for anyone untrained in command-line usage.


#### Vice-President (Human Resource and Development), _National University of Singapore Students' Computing Club_

* _August 2015 - September 2016_ (18th Management Committee)
* Oversaw a portfolio of 3 cells (academic liaison, student welfare, sports), helping to maximise the impact of their activities while also staying within NUS regulations
* Facilitated the expansion of student welfare with significantly more welfare packs and additional events such as during Halloween
* Facilitated and supervised the NUS Data Science Student Challenge organised by the Academic Liaison Cell together with Microsoft, the first ever hackathon organised by the Club


#### Director of Academic Liaison, _National University of Singapore Students' Computing Club_

* _August 2014 - September 2015_ (17th Management Committee)
* Spearheaded several workshops to help students acquire practical computing skills
  * Java Confidence Course
  * Unix Workshop
  * Introduction to Hybrid Mobile Apps (sponsored by JetBrains)
* Organised a day-long sharing session for incoming freshmen with the objective of giving them a clear picture of academic life and career prospects after graduation
* Organised mock practical examinations for freshmen to become acquainted with the actual environment of the practical examinations in the School of Computing
