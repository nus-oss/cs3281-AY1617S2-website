## Expert Areas

### Java

- Given a lightning talk on [Java generic](https://github.com/nus-oss/lightningtalks/issues/34), which introduced the design behind Java generic. The talk also showed several pitfalls and their corresponding best practices in using Java generic.
- Written 7000-8000 lines of code in Java for both OSS projects and school projects.

### Code Quality

- Given a lightning talk on [code quality best practices](https://github.com/nus-oss/lightningtalks/issues/4).
- Applied some best practices such as builder pattern and factory pattern in *Effective Java* to OSS project: TEAMMATES.
- Refactored the log system of OSS project: TEAMMATES, which helped improve the code quality.


### Static Analysis

- Given a lightning talk on [customized checks in CheckStyle](https://github.com/nus-oss/lightningtalks/issues/60), which helped audience know more about the mechanisms behind static analysis tools. In addition, it also showed a way to enforce extra coding standards in a project.
- Written a book chapter: [Introduction to static analysis in Java](https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/pull/2). It helps beginners to learn the concepts of static analysis and make use of static analysis tools quickly.
- Written a technical report of [static analysis in TEAMMATES](https://xpdavid.github.io/CS2103R-Report/), which helped enforce extra standards and improve the code quality in TEAMMATES.

### Other Technical Skills

- Proficient in SQL and DBMS
- Enthusiast of PHP, HTML and JavaScript
- Familiar with Google App Engine
