# CS3281 Schedule

## Week 1

* Lecture : Module Intro
* Update GitHub profile: As most of your work will be submitted via GitHub, you are strongly recommended to update 
  your GitHub profile with your full name and a suitable profile photo (i.e. similar to those used for 
  identification cards).
* Add your details to the module website [Deadline: Friday]
  * Create a pull request to add the following to this repo.
    * Your Resume:
      * Follow the folder/file convention used by this placeholder file `students/AY1617S2/johnDoe/JohnDoe-Resume.md`.
      * It can be in markdown format or html. Place any additional files you need (e.g. css, images) 
        in the same folder.
        
        > **Can it be a PDF?** We require a text-based resume so that we can track the changes to it during the semester. 
        > Also, you should also have (even _prefer_) a text-based resume because some big companies 
        > (and head-hunting agencies) use text bots to process resumes.
        
      * Length 1-1.5 pages. You may want to read up some online advice on writing good tech resumes. Write it as if
        you will use it for internship/job applications in the near future.
    * Your details in this page [this file](../students/AY1617S2/StudentList.md). 
      * The project assignment in the above file is based on your first preference given in the application form. 
        A project change is still possible within week 1, subject to approval.
  * The PR name can be something like `Add Details: John Doe`.
  * Use a different branch for your PR. The branch name can be something like `add-details-john-doe`. This way it
      is easier to keep your master branch exactly same as upstream repo
   
  > Note: **If you are using markdown**, please pay attention to 
  > [this advice on making your markdown code compatible with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Gfmd.md#follow-strict-gfmd-syntax-to-be-compatible-with-github-pages).

## Week 2

* Lecture : Briefing on giving tech talks

## Week 3

* Lecture : Lightning Talks Round A - Part 1

* Some things to consider when preparing for the talk:
  1. Remember to start the talk with a PUNCH, WIIFY, and the Promise.<br> 
     The WIIFY can work better if it relates to the audience at a concrete level. 
     For example, explaining ‘how Foo technology can benefit you right now’ is better than making a general claim that 
     ‘Foo is a useful technology’. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefitting many others, 
     but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>
     WIIFY can be revisited at the end of the talk too.
  1. One common mistake is inadvertantly including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept
     that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br>
     Peers reviewing a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can 
     spot those holes.
  1. Also show how the topic fits into the big picture. For example, let’s say your topic is a tool called X. 
     _The ‘big picture’ view can be something like this: There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential
     part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. 
     Tool X is the currently hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools 
     in that category, namely Y and Z._ 
* Please limit the length to 7 minutes. The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&A.
* Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance.
* No laptops allowed during talks (except the speaker).
* Note down comments about the talk on paper (provided).
* Before the end of Monday:
  * Speakers should update the issue description of the talk by adding slides.
  * Edit the issue description (rather than add as a new comment) to update the synopsys (if needed) and add the slides.
    Note that GitHub allows attaching ppt files. Just drag-drop the files to the comment box.
* Before the end of Tuesday:
  * All must submit feedback to speakers (via TEAMMATES). The quality of feedback is considered in grading.
   
* Feel free to continue the discussion about each talk in the issue tracker.
