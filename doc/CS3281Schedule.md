# CS3281 Schedule

## Week 1

* Lecture : Module Intro
* Update GitHub profile: As most of your work will be submitted via GitHub, you are strongly recommended to update 
  your GitHub profile with your full name and a suitable profile photo (i.e. similar to those used for 
  identification cards).
* Add your details to the module website [Deadline: Friday]
  * Create a pull request to add the following to this repo.
    * Your Resume:
      * Follow the folder/file convention used by this placeholder file `students/AY1617S2/johnDoe/JohnDoe-Resume.md`.
      * It can be in markdown format or html. Place any additional files you need (e.g. css, images) 
        in the same folder.
        
        > **Can it be a PDF?** We require a text-based resume so that we can track the changes to it during the semester. 
        > Also, you should also have (even _prefer_) a text-based resume because some big companies 
        > (and head-hunting agencies) use text bots to process resumes.
        
      * Length 1-1.5 pages. You may want to read up some online advice on writing good tech resumes. Write it as if
        you will use it for internship/job applications in the near future.
    * Your details in this page [this file](../students/AY1617S2/StudentList.md). 
      * The project assignment in the above file is based on your first preference given in the application form. 
        A project change is still possible within week 1, subject to approval.
  * The PR name can be something like `Add Details: John Doe`.
  * Use a different branch for your PR. The branch name can be something like `add-details-john-doe`. This way it
      is easier to keep your master branch exactly same as upstream repo
   
  > Note: **If you are using markdown**, please pay attention to
