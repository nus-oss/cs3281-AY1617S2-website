# Stage 1 : Learning

## Week 1

* Set up the dev environment in your Computer. Follow instructions provided by the project for new contributors.

* Lecture : Module Intro

* Saturday: Code Sprint 0900- 1600 (SR10)

  > The code sprint is an opportunity for you to spend an extended amount of time on the project so that you get a solid start to the
  > coding activities. Some project mentors may be available during this time for you to discuss project related matters with them.
  
  * 0930 - 1200 : Project work, mock interviews
  * 1200 - 1300 : Lunch break (lunch not provided)

  * 1530 - 1700 : Project work, mock interviews

## Week 2

* By Wednesday midnight: Create a PR against this repo to report weekly progress.
  * Follow the folder/file convention and the template used by this placeholder file 
    [`students/AY1617S2/johnDoe/JohnDoe-Progress.md`](../students/AY1617S2/johnDoe/JohnDoe-Progress.md).
  * Only merged PRs can be included. 
    A merged PR can be included in any future week (not restricted to the week it was merged). 
  * PRs done prior to the semester can be included in this week or in a future week.
  * **Effort** : Your estimated _number of hours the work should have taken in retrospect_. 
    Use only values `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32` (rounded to the nearest number).
  * **Type** : Indicates whether you are the developer (`D`) or the reviewer (`R`).
  * Format for PR title `Week 2 Progress: John Doe`
  * Use a different branch for each PR. The branch name can be something like `john-doe-week2-progress`. This way it
    is easier to keep your master branch exactly same as upstream repo.

* Lecture : Project specific discussions

## Week 3

* Continue to submit weekly progress by creating PRs. Marks will be uploaded to IVLE in due course.
